# 4x5-film-masks-beseler
3D models for 4x5 film masks for a custom negative holder for my Beseler 45MX enlarger.

## Why

These are specifically for a project I'm working on regarding a 4x5 AN glass holder I came up with to solve some particularly curly negatives.

## How to print

I print this in polycarbonate filament on an Airwolf AXIOM using the default standard setting at 100% fill. Depending on your filament, you may want to increase the heat/flow of the default setting (I use 295 @ 110% flow to make sure I get a light tight 1mm solid).
